I wanted to create my version of the game and there fore I didn\'92t take a full tutorial and implement it I watched this tutorial to help me get started with creating the game {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz8Ga9er3_8"}}{\fldrslt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz8Ga9er3_8}} and then I read this article {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-snake-game"}}{\fldrslt https://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-snake-game}} after that I had the game up and running but not moving very smooth so I wanted to make it move around in a smooth way so I used this link {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/need-help-with-grid-based-movement-in-c.276793/"}}{\fldrslt https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/need-help-with-grid-based-movement-in-c.276793/}} and created a mach up movement system from the above links and my version of them.\
